        <h2>Differnce between Var,Let and Const </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>var is function-scoped while let and const are block-scoped.</li>
            <li>var variables can be reassigned while let and const variables can not.</li>
            <li>var variables are declared using the var keyword while let and const variables are declared using the
                let and const keywords respectively.
            </li>
            <li>const variables are immutable while let and var variables are not.

        <h2>Differnce between arrow function and regular function</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Syntax:
                A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow
                functions.
            </li>
            <li>Arguments binding:
                object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments.</li>
            <li>Use of this keyword:
                Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the value
                of this depends on how the function is invoked.
                The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the regular function’s this
                behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword.</li>
            <li>Using a new keyword:
                Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new keyword.
                But, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be
                used as constructor functions.</li>

        <h2>Differnce between forEach(), map(), filter(), find()</h2>
        <ul>
            <h3>Definition</h3>

            <li>Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate through array
                items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example, an array of objects with a
                lot of entries than just an array of integers.</li>
            <li>Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each element’s content in an array that it is
                called on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the array that it is called on will
                stay still.</li>

            <li>Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the assigned
                condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a certain integer, or
                by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property that is equal to
                something.</li>

            <li>Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail — this
                function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the function will
                return the first that has matched.</li>
            </li>
            <h4>Use:</h4>

            <li>.forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array.</li>

            <li>.map() when you want to transform elements in an array.</li>

            <li>.filter() when you want to select a subset of multiple elements from an array.</li>

            <li>.find() When you want to select a single element from an array.</li>
